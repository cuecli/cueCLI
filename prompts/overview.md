# CueSesh: The Adaptive Media Curation Platform

## Core Concept
CueSesh is an adaptive media curation platform that intelligently surfaces podcast and audio content based on user context, available time, and preferences. It's designed to maximize the value of "in-between" moments by perfectly fitting content to available time windows.

## The Adaptive Media Player Architecture

### Multi-Source Integration:
• Apple Podcasts: Primary discovery source (no API key required)
• Listen Notes: On-select enrichment for detailed metadata and audio URLs
• RSS: Fallback for audio enclosures when other sources fail
• Spotify: Optional integration for authenticated users
• YouTube: Future integration planned

### Smart Session Management:
• Session duration: 5-120 minutes (UI limit, with extended session capability)
• Playback speeds: 0.75x to 2.0x with contextual labels (Careful, Natural, Relaxed, Optimal, Fast, Maximum)
• Content blocks: 15-30 minute segments for seamless transitions
• Progressive content loading to handle sessions beyond 2 hours

## Technical Implementation

### Performance-First Architecture:
• On-Select Enrichment: Only fetches detailed data when user selects content
• Multi-Layer Caching: Client-side (7 days) and server-side (24 hours) caching
• Initial Load: <100ms with static cache
• Playback Start: <500ms with direct audio URLs
• 89% enrichment coverage across 999+ podcasts

### Data Flow:
1. Dashboard/Discover screens load minimal Apple Podcasts data
2. User selects content → triggers enrichment
3. Checks local EnrichSnapshot cache first
4. If not cached, calls /api/enrich/on-select endpoint
5. Falls back to RSS if Listen Notes lacks audio URL
6. Caches response with TTL headers
