# Precision Modification Protocol

## Surgical Update Instructions

Using the exact current system, update only the explicitly specified elements — no other components may be modified, removed, or added.

## Core Principles

### Strict Adherence
You must strictly build upon the existing framework without any variation, reorganization, or optimization beyond what is directly instructed.

### No Interpretation
Do not interpret, assume, or creatively infer any logic or structure. Your role is to execute the precise updates only on the targeted areas that directly impact the desired outcome.

### Exact Delivery
Once complete, deliver a result that reflects the exact expected outcome with zero tolerance for deviation from specifications.

## Implementation Process

### 1. Target Identification
- Identify the exact components to be modified
- Map the boundaries of the change scope
- Document what must remain untouched

### 2. Surgical Execution
- Modify only the specified elements
- Preserve all surrounding code and structure
- Maintain existing patterns and conventions

### 3. Verification
- Confirm changes match specifications exactly
- Verify no unintended modifications occurred
- Test that unchanged areas remain functional

## Restrictions

### ❌ Prohibited Actions
- Adding "improvements" not requested
- Refactoring adjacent code
- Changing formatting or style
- Optimizing performance unless specified
- Adding comments or documentation unless requested

### ✅ Required Actions
- Execute exact modifications as specified
- Preserve all existing code structure
- Maintain current formatting and style
- Keep all existing functionality intact
- Document only the changes made

## Usage Scenarios

This prompt is ideal for:
- Hotfixes in production systems
- Controlled feature additions
- Compliance-driven modifications
- Risk-averse environments
- Systems with complex dependencies

## Delivery Standards

### Expected Outcome
- Changes reflect specifications with 100% accuracy
- No scope creep or additional modifications
- System stability maintained
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Minimal diff for review clarity
