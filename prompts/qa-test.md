# CueSesh QA Testing Protocol

## Task: Comprehensive Quality Assurance Simulation

### Test Scope: Complete End-to-End User Journey + Deep Code Audit

## Phase 1: User Persona Testing

### Simulate 10 Diverse User Profiles:

1. **Power User** (Tech-savvy, rapid navigation, keyboard shortcuts)
2. **Senior User** (60+, larger text needs, slower interactions)
3. **Busy Parent** (Interrupted sessions, one-handed use, background noise)
4. **Commuter** (Subway/train, intermittent connectivity, glove usage)
5. **Accessibility User** (Screen reader, voice control, high contrast)
6. **International User** (Non-English, RTL text, different formats)
7. **Low-End Device** (Android 8, 2GB RAM, slow processor)
8. **Premium iPhone User** (Latest iOS, expects polish, gesture-heavy)
9. **First-Time User** (No podcast experience, needs guidance)
10. **Impatient User** (Skips everything, taps multiple times, force quits)

## Phase 2: Onboarding Flow Validation

### Entry Points Testing:
✓ Fresh install → First launch
✓ Deep link → Onboarding redirect
✓ Returning user → Skip detection
✓ Partial completion → Resume state

### Each Onboarding Screen Must:
- [ ] Load in < 1 second
- [ ] Show loading states (no blank screens)
- [ ] Handle rapid tapping without crashes
- [ ] Validate all inputs with clear errors
- [ ] Save progress on each step
- [ ] Allow backward navigation
- [ ] Work in landscape and portrait
- [ ] Maintain state on app background

### Critical Onboarding Checks:
```javascript
// Topics Selection
- Minimum 1 topic required
- Maximum handling (can select all?)
- Visual feedback on selection
- Search/filter functionality
- Deselection allowed

// Time/Distance Input
- Validates numeric only
- Handles edge cases (0, 999, decimals)
- Units clearly displayed
- Keyboard type correct (numeric)
- Auto-advances when complete

// Final "Curate" Button
- MUST populate real podcasts
- Loading indicator while fetching
- Error state if API fails
- Success leads to Dashboard
- Analytics event fires
```

## Phase 3: Core Feature Testing

### Dashboard Content Population:

**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
✅ Real podcasts load (not mock data)
✅ Matches selected topics
✅ Respects time/distance parameters
✅ Content has valid audio URLs
✅ Images load without broken links
✅ Infinite scroll triggers at bottom
✅ No duplicate content items

### Player Screen Validation:

#### Audio Controls:
- [ ] Play/Pause toggles correctly
- [ ] Progress bar updates real-time
- [ ] Seek forward/backward (±15 sec)
- [ ] Volume slider (0-100%)
- [ ] Mute button state persists
- [ ] Background play continues

#### Speed Optimizer:
- [ ] Speed range: 0.5x to 3.0x
- [ ] Pitch preservation at all speeds
- [ ] UI updates to show current speed
- [ ] Saves preference for next session
- [ ] Smooth transition (no audio glitch)

#### Media Compatibility:
- [ ] MP3 files play
- [ ] M4A files play  
- [ ] AAC streams work
- [ ] HLS streams supported
- [ ] Handles 404 audio URLs gracefully
- [ ] Switches to proxy on CORS failure

### Navigation & Routing:

#### Every Screen Transition:
- [ ] < 300ms transition time
- [ ] No white flash
- [ ] State preserved on back
- [ ] Gesture navigation works (iOS)
- [ ] Hardware back works (Android)
- [ ] Deep links route correctly

## Phase 4: Code Quality Audit

### Find & Flag:

#### Hardcoded Values:
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG
const API_KEY = "sk-12345"
const MAX_ITEMS = 50

// ✅ CORRECT  
const API_KEY = process.env.VITE_API_KEY
const MAX_ITEMS = config.limits.maxItems
```

#### State Management Issues:
```javascript
// Check for:
- Direct state mutations
- Missing Redux actions
- Uncontrolled components
- Effect dependency errors
- Memory leaks in useEffect
- Missing cleanup functions
```

#### Error Handling Gaps:
```javascript
// Every API call needs:
try {
  // API call
} catch (error) {
  // User-friendly error
  // Log to analytics
  // Fallback behavior
} finally {
  // Loading state cleanup
}
```

#### Performance Bottlenecks:
```javascript
// Flag:
- Unoptimized images (>200KB)
- Missing React.memo
- Inline function definitions
- Excessive re-renders
- Large bundle chunks (>500KB)
- Blocking API calls
```

## Phase 5: Stress Testing

### Network Conditions:
- Airplane mode (offline)
- 2G speed (50 Kbps)
- Intermittent (drops every 30s)
- High latency (2000ms)
- Packet loss (10%)

### User Behavior Chaos:
- Tap button 10 times rapidly
- Background app during loading
- Force quit during API call
- Rotate device while animating
- Switch apps during audio play
- Clear storage while running
- Deny permissions midflow

### Edge Cases:
- 0 search results
- 500 topics selected
- 10-hour session time
- Empty form submission
- Special characters in input
- Time zone changes
- Language switch mid-session

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run automated tests
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:accessibility  
npm run test:performance

# Generate reports
npm run audit:bundle

## Remember
Test like a user who's having their worst day - rushed, frustrated, and on a terrible connection. If it works for them, it works for everyone.
